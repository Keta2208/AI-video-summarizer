### üìë How It Works
Transcription: The app extracts the transcript from YouTube videos using youtube-transcript-api or transcribes uploaded videos using Whisper.
Text Segmentation: We use spaCy for better segmentation of the transcript into sentences and sections.
Summarization: The app uses the T5 model for generating summaries of video content.
Classification: The app classifies the video into categories like Motivational, Educational, Business, and more using the Zero-Shot Classification model.

### üé® UI Design
The user interface is designed with Tailwind CSS for a responsive and modern look. It features:

Dark/Light Mode Toggle: Easily switch between light and dark modes for a better user experience.
Collapsible Sections: Summary sections are collapsible for easier navigation.
Attractive Layout: A minimalist and clean layout with a glassmorphism effect for a sleek design.

### üîß Built With
Flask: For building the web application.
spaCy: For text processing and NLP tasks.
Transformers: For powerful text summarization using T5.
Whisper: For transcribing audio to text.
